title: Preprint upload
---
  
Our project discussed preprints, so of course we also upload a preprint of our scientific manuscript. We chose MetaArXiv.io as the best location for our work. 

Our preprint "Constructing and implementing PRECHECK: A checklist to evaluate preprints on COVID-19 and beyond" can be found [here](https://osf.io/preprints/metaarxiv/nb928).
