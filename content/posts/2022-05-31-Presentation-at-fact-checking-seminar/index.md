title: Presentation at "fact checking" seminar
---
  
The team at University of Zurich was invited by the "Association suisse du journalisme scientifique" to give a talk at their Seminar entitled "Fact checking for science journalists â€“ how to make sure the story is true". The PRECHECK project was the perfect topic for that seminar so that Rachel and Nora went to Bern and gave a presentation and a small hand-on tutorial. The idea and implementation of the checklist was well received and we got some valuable and positive feedback. 

The seminar is advertised [here](https://www.science-journalism.ch/event/spring-seminar-2022).
