We are now in the testing and validation phase of our new checklist. This entails presenting and discussing the checklist with our target audience (i.e. medicine and psychology students and science journalists). In small hands-on workshops or tutorial we let them use the checklist on different preprints. The results are discussed in class or in the workshop.
