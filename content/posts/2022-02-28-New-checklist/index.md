title: New checklist
---
  
Our new checklist is finalised and available from our website as HTML version. In the following weeks/months we will use the checklist as teaching material for medical and psychology students. The aim of our short-lectures on scientific publishing and preprints is to teach the students how to critically read scientific literature and especially non-peer reviewed preprints.
