title: Invitations for external review sent
---
  
We've reached another milestone! We have identified an array of methodologists, metaresearchers, journal editors (in psychology and medicine), and science journalists for an external review of the PRECHECK checklist (10-15 participants per group). We've invited them to fill an anonymous survey where they are to rate the relevance of each 1) category of items, 2) item, and 3) Let's Dig Deeper section on their relevance for evaluating the quality of preprints.

The responses are slowly rolling in so remember to watch this space for updates!
