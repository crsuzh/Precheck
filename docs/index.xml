      <description>Nora and Rachel finished incorporating the changes suggested by the expert survey. We decided on the categories and the elements to keep. We are currently having a final internal feedback loop to make sure we answered to all the comments, ensure the new checklist is still able to discriminate between good and bad preprints and all element of the checklist can be processed by our target audience.</description>

      <title>Evaluating expert survey and extending checklist</title>

      <description>We sent out a total of 53 invitations and two reminders. At the end we got 26 filled surveys. We started analysing the answers. The experts could tell us whether they considered our elements are relevant or not. This helped us to know which elements and categories should stay in the final checklist and which needed to be update. Finally, we could incorporate the written feedback which the experts could give us at the end of the survey.</description>

      <title>Invitations for external review sent</title>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve reached another milestone! We have identified an array of methodologists, metaresearchers, journal editors (in psychology and medicine), and science journalists for an external review of the PRECHECK checklist (10-15 participants per group). We&amp;rsquo;ve invited them to fill an anonymous survey where they are to rate the relevance of each 1) category of items, 2) item, and 3) Let&amp;rsquo;s Dig Deeper section on their relevance for evaluating the quality of preprints.</description>

      <title>Checking the checklist internally</title>

      <description>After several rounds of amendments, we reached a state where all of us were happy with the checklist. Then the time came to put it to the test!
A good checklist should be able to correctly &amp;lsquo;accept&amp;rsquo; a good preprint and correctly &amp;lsquo;reject&amp;rsquo; a bad preprint - but could the PRECHECK checklist in its current state do that? Simon and Nora worked to find out. For &amp;lsquo;bad&amp;rsquo; preprints, they selected three retracted COVID-19 preprints.</description>

      <title>First preprint-themed lecture at the University of Geneva</title>

      <description>Nora Turoman from our team taught a guest-lecture entitled &amp;ldquo;Preprints and peer-review: a deep dive&amp;rdquo;, as part of the Bachelors in Psychology course &amp;ldquo;Compï¿½tences et connaissances scientifiques en psychologie&amp;rdquo; at the University of Geneva.
Inspired by Tobias Wingen&amp;rsquo;s preprint (https://osf.io/7n3mj) showing that a short paragraph explaining preprints and peer-review can change how laypeople perceive the trustworthiness of scientific findings, Nora started the lecture with a practical session that, like the Wingen preprint, asked students to rate the trustworthiness of excerpts from a handful of scientific papers.</description>

      <description>The project Precheck started in April 2021 and ends in September 2022. We gratefully received a research grant by the UNIGE-UZH Joint Funding for Collaboration in Research and Teaching. The aim of this project is to assess the quality of preprints in research, for more informations see About.
Two researchers will co-lead this project, Nora Turoman (University of Geneva) and Simon Schwab (University of Zurich). The project is supervised by Evie Vergauwe (University of Geneva), Leonhard Held and Eva Furrer (University of Zurich).</description>
